Welcome to Pages! This is a web application designed to help you keep track of your notes securely and efficiently. You can use Pages without logging in, but be aware that any notes created as a guest will be lost if the page is reloaded.

- **User Registration & Login**: Register for an account to save your notes securely. Your password is protected by hashing, ensuring that it is never stored in plaintext. You will see the username and Logout button on top right when logged in.

- **CRUD Operations**: Pages supports all basic operationsâ€”Create, Read, Update, and Delete notes. Changes are reflected immediately across the UI.
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend is built with Tailwind CSS and React, ensuring a modern and responsive user experience.
